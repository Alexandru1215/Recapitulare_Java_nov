        //  object  -  an instance of a class that may contain attributes and methods
        // attributes - characteristics that this obj 'has'
        // methods  -   as the different 'actions' that this obj can perform


        //abstract = abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can have a subclass
        //           abstract methods are declared without an implementation.
        //   adding abstract keyword to a class adds a layer of security

        // Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(); - can't instantiated
       // Car1 car1 =  new Car1();  // child class Car1 implements abstract methods from super Class Vehicle
       // car1.go();
